<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="http://confreaks.com/events">Confreaks</a></h2>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t make it to that great conference, maybe you can find it on <a href="http://confreaks.com/events">Confreaks</a>. There are 54 events at the time I am writing this post, most of them Ruby related covering a great variety of topics.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.rubyconf.com.br/">RubyConf Brasil</a> is the only big conference that I used to go, for everything else there&rsquo;s Confreaks, videos are available for free.</p>

<h2><a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Get the newest and hottest development resources from PeepCode, well before theyâ€™re covered in books&rdquo; described well their one-hour tutorials, $12 each.</p>

<p>Besides the tutorials, there is the exceptional <a href="https://peepcode.com/screencasts/play-by-play">Play by Play series</a> where you can watch experts working in some task given by <a href="https://twitter.com/topfunky">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a></h2>

<p>Screencasts covering Unix, Testing, OO Design, Git, Vim and dynamic languages (with a Ruby focus), $9/month.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a> was the first invited expert to the <a href="https://peepcode.com/screencasts/play-by-play">Play by Play series</a> and I think he liked, since he has already produced more than 70 screencasts after that.</p>

<p>Watching his screencasts is like having another developer in the team giving you some great tips and advices.</p>

<h2><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a></h2>

<p>Screencasts about Rails and related projects and techniques. There are free, revised and pro episodes. The last two are only available for RailsCast Pro subscribers, $9/month. There is a transcription and a github repository for each episode.</p>

<p>Ryan Bates has been doing a great work covering a lot of projects, some of them I&rsquo;ve heard about first from his screencasts.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
