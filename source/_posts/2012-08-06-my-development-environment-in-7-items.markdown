A few centuries ago [Almir Mendes] and [Paulo Jeveaux] posted about their development environment in 7 items and suggest me to do the same. So, here they are:

Machine/OS
----------

Mac Mini as my main work machine and a macbook pro when I need mobility.

It's a pleasure to work with Mac OS and the main reason: it doesn't bother me with many issues that I used to deal with other OSes. After 5 years using it, I feel at home.

Editor
------

[SublimeText] could be seen only as a good editor just for being a [Textmate] on steroids and great for many developers, but not for me. However, its [vintage mode][Vintage] really got me, since I've been a [Vim] user for years, plus its customization and look and feel are superb.

Terminal
--------

Bash + Terminal.app. In addition, currently I'm trying [iTerm2], so far, so good.

Browser
-------

[Chrome] with the following extensions: [Delicious Bookmarks][Delicious], [MeasureIt!], [Screen Capture], [Send to Kindle], [feedly], [1Password] and [Gist.IO Page Switcher][gist.io].

Tools
------

* [Propane]: [Campfire] client to work and have fun with human beings.
* [iTunes]: Best podcast manager that I've used so far. It's a music player as well.
* [Alfred]: It isn't just an application launcher, it's my personal jack of all trades. I just type Cmd+Space (my custom hotkey for it) and with a few strokes I'm able to navigate through folders and files, send email messages, play songs and much more.
* [Homebrew]: package manager to make life easier for developers.

Source Code
------------

[Git] + [Github]/[Bitbucket]. Besides git command line tools, I use [GitX] to browse through history log and review commits. Just a note: I don't miss SVN and CVS at all. 

Music
------

I listen to some random album from my [iTunes] library usually, but when things got serious I listen to [emancipator], that helps me to focus more.

Your turn
----------

So, about you? What are your 7 items?
