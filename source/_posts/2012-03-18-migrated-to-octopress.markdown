A few weeks ago I hired a VPS to put some personal projects and decided to migrate my blog from Wordpress after reading a blog post of [Almir Mendes][almir] talking about [Octopress][oct].

## Hmm... ok... so, what is Octopress?

Imagine a [CMS][cms] with an yml file instead of a dashboard, posts and pages being written in [plain text format][markdown] stored in folders/files that allows you to maintain all of it in any version control system, as Git, and deploying so easy as transfering some files to a folder. Sounds good? If "yes", [Octopress][oct] is for you.

## Easy to install/setup

If you are a software developer, it's gonna be easy, if a ruby developer, trivial and if non-developer it'll be... like a puzzle. The [documentation][octdocs] is really helpful, covering installation, customization, deploying... pretty much everything.

As I chose [Nginx][nginx], I used an extra help from [Bigdinosaur Blog][octnginx] to setup it correctly.

## What about the old blog?

I didn't migrate the posts because I'm gonna update them before reposting. And the old domain will be redirecting to this one temporally.

So, bye bye Wordpress!
